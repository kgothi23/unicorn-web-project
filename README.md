# CI/CD Pipeline Setup with AWS Services

This project demonstrates the integration of AWS services to build a fully managed CI/CD pipeline. 
It includes a comprehensive setup for version control, artifact management, build automation, containerization, and serverless application deployment.

## Overview

The following AWS services are used in this project:

1. **AWS CodeCommit/GitLab**: For source code version control.
2. **AWS CodeArtifact**: For storing build artifacts.
3. **AWS CodeBuild**: To automate the build process.
4. **AWS CodeDeploy**: For managing application deployments.
5. **AWS CodePipeline**: To orchestrate the entire CI/CD pipeline.
6. **Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: For storing container images.
7. **AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)**: For deploying serverless applications.

---

## Features

- **Version Control**: Source code is managed using AWS CodeCommit or GitLab repositories.
- **Build Automation**: Automated builds using AWS CodeBuild with output stored in AWS CodeArtifact.
- **Deployment Management**: Continuous delivery and deployment using AWS CodeDeploy.
- **Containerization**: Support for containerized applications using Amazon ECR.
- **Serverless Deployments**: Serverless applications are deployed using AWS SAM.
- **End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline**: Fully automated and managed workflow using AWS CodePipeline.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure the following:

1. An AWS account with the necessary permissions to access CodeCommit, CodeArtifact, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, Amazon ECR, and AWS SAM.
2. AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
3. Basic understanding of Git and containerization.
4. Docker installed locally for building container images.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Version Control**
   - Use AWS CodeCommit or GitLab to host your source code.
   - Push your application code to the repository.

### 2. **Artifact Repository**
   - Create an AWS CodeArtifact repository to store build artifacts.
   - Configure CodeArtifact with your AWS CLI or build tool.

### 3. **Build Process**
   - Set up AWS CodeBuild with a `buildspec.yml` file in your repository.
   - Define build steps such as compilation, testing, and packaging in the `buildspec.yml`.

### 4. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Configure AWS CodeDeploy to handle deployments to target environments.
   - Define deployment settings, such as rolling updates or blue/green deployments.

### 5. **CI/CD Orchestration**
   - Create an AWS CodePipeline with the following stages:
     - **Source Stage**: Pulls code from CodeCommit or GitLab.
     - **Build Stage**: Executes the CodeBuild project.
     - **Deploy Stage**: Manages deployments via CodeDeploy.

### 6. **Containerization**
   - Build Docker images and push them to Amazon ECR.
   - Integrate container builds with CodeBuild for automated image creation.

### 7. **Serverless Application Deployment**
   - Use AWS SAM to define and deploy serverless applications.
   - Create a `template.yaml` file for your serverless resources.

## Usage

1. Push changes to the source repository.
2. CodePipeline automatically triggers the CI/CD workflow.
3. Build artifacts are generated and stored in CodeArtifact.
4. Container images (if any) are uploaded to Amazon ECR.
5. Applications are deployed to target environments using CodeDeploy or AWS SAM.

---

## Benefits

- Simplified CI/CD pipeline setup with fully managed AWS services.
- Scalable and efficient deployment process.
- Support for both traditional and serverless applications.
- Enhanced collaboration and productivity through automation.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Pipeline Errors**: Check AWS CodePipeline logs for stage-specific issues.
- **Build Failures**: Review the `buildspec.yml` file and CodeBuild logs.
- **Deployment Issues**: Debug using AWS CodeDeploy logs or rollback mechanisms.
- **ECR Issues**: Ensure Docker is configured correctly, and the ECR repository exists.
